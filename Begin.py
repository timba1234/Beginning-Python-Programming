# 1. Create an if-else statement that asks "if intA IS equal to intC"
# then print the following message if the condition evaluates to True:
# "intA is equal to intC"

# 2. Create an if-statement that asks " if intA is NOT equal to intC"
# then print the following message if the condition evaluates to True:
# "intA is NOT equakl to intC"

# 3. Create an if-statement that asks "if intA is greater than or equal to intC"
# then print the following message if the condition evaluates to True:
# "intA is greateer than or equal to intC"

# 4. Create an if-statement that asks "if intA is less than or equal to intC"
# then print the following message if the condition evaluates to True:
# "intA is less than or equal to intC"

# 5. Create an if-else statement that asks "if intA IS equal to intC"
# then print the following message if the condition evaluated to True:
# "intA is equal to intC" else print "intA is not equal to intC"
